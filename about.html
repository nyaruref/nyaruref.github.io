Hey all, I'm lig0schndr, but you can call me liger. This website is dedicated to documenting and explaining the numerous references in <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%80%99%E3%81%84%E3%82%88%E3%82%8C!_%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AB%E5%AD%90%E3%81%95%E3%82%93">"Haiyore! Nyaruko-san" (這いよれ! ニャル子さん)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaruko:_Crawling_with_Love">"Crawl! Nyaruko"</a>, an anime series that aired in 2012 and 2013.<br>
<br>
The series contains a lot of references to all sorts of things, such as the Cthulhu Mythos, anime, manga, novels, games, super heroes, music, and Japanese culture in general. I think it's a lot of fun if the viewer gets the references and jokes, but if the viewer doesn't then I feel like a lot of enjoyment with the show is lost. I hope that this website helps people understand the references in the series and enjoy the series more.<br>
<br>
With a lot of help from many people, I was able to put together a pretty extensive compilation. I've done my best to document as many references as possible, and explain things as correctly as I can. If there is a reference I haven't documented yet, or if I made a mistake, please feel free to let me know! I really appreciate any help in informing me of additional references or things to correct. I can be contacted at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lig0schndr/">lig0schndr</a> on reddit. Thanks!<br>
