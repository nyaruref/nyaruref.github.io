"It looks like a WonderTsuan Crystal." (1:18), (1:24)<br>
There are three references here:<br>
* The pink handheld that Mahiro is holding is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WonderSwan#SwanCrystal">SwanCrystal</a>, the third and final release in Bandai's WonderSwan handheld game console series. Image for reference:<br>

Source of image: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wonder-Swan-Crystal.jpg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wonder-Swan-Crystal.jpg</a><br>
* The Japanese dialogue is "Wandaa Tsuan Kurisutaru ni niteiru ki ga shimasu ga" (ワンダーツァンクリスタルに似ている気がしますが). Tsuan (ツァン), or Tsang, is a reference to the Plateau of Tsang (ツァン高原 Tsuan Kougen), a fictional location in the Cthulhu Mythos that appears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horror_from_the_Hills">"The Horror from the Hills"</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Belknap_Long">Frank Belknap Long</a> and is where the Great Old One <a href="http://cthulhufiles.com/cthsectc.htm#chaugnar_faugn">Chaugnar Faugn</a> reigns.<sup>S7,S11</sup><br>
* The boxes below Yoichi's right arm read "Kurenai no Buta" (紅の豚), or "Porco Rosso". This name is referencing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porco_Rosso">movie by that name</a> produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a>.<sup>S2</sup> Here is an isolation that might be easier to read:<br>

<br>
"I want to play Gunpey." (1:21)<br>
This is referencing the action puzzle game series <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUNPEY">"GUNPEY" (グンペイ Ganpei)</a>.<sup>S1</sup> The first game in the series, "GUNPEY", was released in 1999 as a launch title for the WonderSwan. Since then there have been several variations released, the most recent being "GUNPEY-R", released for the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP in 2007.<br>
<br>
"It's our top priority." (3:34)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Saiyuusen jikou yo!" (最優先事項よ！). This is the catch phrase of Kazami Mizuho from the anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Please_Teacher!">"Please Teacher!"</a>. On a related note, the person who voiced Mizuho, <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=542">Inoue Kikuko</a>, also voiced Yoriko in the "Haiyore!

(3:46)<br>
This scene is a parody of a common scenario in anime and manga and such, wherein characters will crash into each other at a corner due to being in a hurry and not watching out for other people. Characters running to school with toast in their mouths due to being late is also a common occurrence. The true origin of this scenario is unknown, however one well known occurrence of it is in episode 26 of <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=49">"Neon Genesis Evangelion"</a>, an anime that aired from 1995 to 1996, wherein nearly the exact same scenario as above occurs between Ikari Shinji and Ayanami Rei, two of the main characters.<sup>S1</sup><br>
<br>
"I can't be the next queen or Dragon God priestess." (4:15)<br>
There are two references here:<br>
* The "next queen" (次期女王 jiki jouou) Nyaruko mentions is referencing the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelique_%28video_game%29">"Angelique"</a>, the first game in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelique_%28Japanese_series%29">"Angelique"</a> series released by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koei">Koei</a>.<sup>S1</sup> In the game there is a queen who rules the cosmos fairly and wisely. However, her power wanes over time, thus a successor must be chosen to replace her. The heroine of the story, Angelique Limoges, is a candidate for becoming the "next queen".<br>
* The "Dragon God Priestess" (龍神の神子 Ryuujin no Miko) Nyaruko mentions is referencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harukanaru_Toki_no_Naka_de">"Harukanaru Toki no Naka de"</a>, another game released by Koei.<sup>S1</sup> The protagonist of the story, Motomiya Akane, and her friends are sucked into a mysterious old well and transported to Kyou, another world that resembles Kyoto during the Heian Period. Once there, Akane is determined to be the Dragon God Priestess who will save Kyou from the Oni clan whose aim is world domination.<br>

(4:35)<br>
Cthuko's uniform is based on the uniform that female students wear in the series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria-sama_ga_Miteru">"Maria-sama ga Miteru"</a>. Image for reference:<br>

(4:37)<br>
There are two references here:<br>
* The line at this time goes as follows:
<blockquote>
「タイが曲がっていてよ。身だしなみはいつもきちんとしないと。アザトース様が見ていらっしゃるわよ。」<br>
<br>
"Tai ga magatte ite yo. Midashinami ha itsumo kichinto shinai to. Azatoosu-sama ga mite irassharu wa yo."<br>
<br>
"Your necktie is crooked. You must always maintain your appearance. Azathoth is watching over us."
</blockquote>
This scene is referencing the same lines and actions said and done by Ogasawara Sachiko in the first episode of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria-sama_ga_Miteru">"Maria-sama ga Miteru"</a>.<sup>S1</sup> Her dialogue goes,
<blockquote>

<br>
"Tai ga magatte ite yo. Midashinami ha itsumo kichinto ne. Maria-sama ga mite irassharu wa yo."<br>

* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathoth">Azathoth</a> is a deity in the Cthulhu Mythos that is said to be "Lord of All Things".<sup>S13</sup> On a related note, Azathoth is called "the blind idiot god" in the Cthulhu Mythos.<sup>S13</sup> How it would be able to watch over anything is a mystery.<sup>S3</sup><br>

<a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/shiai_shuuryou.jpg"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/shiai_shuuryou.jpg"></a><br>
(5:00)<br>
There are two references here:<br>
* The line at this time goes as follows:
<blockquote>
「だが希望を捨てるな。間に合わないと諦めたら、そこで試合終了だぞ」<br>
<br>
"Daga kibou wo suteruna. Maniawanai to akirametara, soko de shiai shuuryou da zo"<br>
<br>
"But don't abandon hope. Once you give up, think it's too late, the game's over."
</blockquote>
This is parodying a line said by Anzai Mitsuyoshi, the coach of the basketball team the protagonist is a part of, in chapter 69 of volume 8 of the manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_Dunk_%28manga%29">"Slam Dunk"</a>.<sup>S1</sup> His original line goes as follows:
<blockquote>
「最後まで・・・希望を捨てちゃいかん。あきらめたらそこで試合終了だよ」<br>
<br>
"Saigo made... kibou wo sutecha ikan. Akirametara soko de shiai shuuryou da yo."<br>
<br>
"Until the end... don't give up hope. Once you give up, the game is over."

He also says almost same line, "Akirametara soko de shiai shuuryou desu yo...?" (あきらめたらそこで試合終了ですよ・・・？), or "Once you give up, the game is over", in chapter 241 of volume 27.<br>
* The uniform Hasta is wearing is parodying that which the protagonists wear in "Slam Dunk" during away games.<sup>S1</sup> In addition, the number 10 on Hasta's uniform is the same number on the uniform of Sakuragi Hanamichi, the protagonist of the series.<sup>S3</sup> Images for reference:<br>

"Hey, I'm Yoichi Takehiko. If you want any information about the girls, just ask me." (5:18)<br>
Yoichi's lines and actions are referencing the visual novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokimeki_Memorial">"Tokimeki Memorial"</a>. In the game the player attempts to woo the girl of his choosing amongst several girls. The dialogue box in the scene is a common element in visual novels. Yoichi's introduction is parodying that of Saotome Yoshio, a friend of the player who can provide information on the available girls. Yoshio's original line goes, "Ma, onnanoko no koto de, shiritai koto ga attara, ore ni renraku shina." (ま、女のこのことで、知りたいことがあったら、俺に連絡しな。), or "Well, if there's anything you want to know about girls, just contact me". Image for reference:<br>

"Your current standing with the girls..." (5:42)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Ima no tokoro, onnanoko tachi no koukando ha..." (今のところ、女の子たちの好感度は・・・). This is referencing how one parameter Yoshio can inform the player of is each girl's affection level. When asked, Yoshio tells the player, "Onnanoko no, omae ni tai suru hyouka ha..." (女の子の、お前に対する評価は・・・。), or "The girls' opinions of you are...". Image for reference:<br>

"I can see the ending!" (8:16)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Kono geemu no endingu ha mieta!" (このゲームのエンディングは見えた！). This line, the glasses, and the characters' poses are all referencing Katsuragi Keima, the protagonist of the manga <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E3%81%AE%E3%81%BF%E3%81%9E%E7%9F%A5%E3%82%8B%E3%82%BB%E3%82%AB%E3%82%A4">"Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai" (神のみぞ知るセカイ)</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_God_Only_Knows">"The World God Only Knows"</a>. In the manga, Keima is forced to make girls fall in love with him in order to drive out evil spirits that have taken refuge in their hearts. Keima is an avid player of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bish%C5%8Djo_game">galge</a>, games in which the player attempts to woo a girl of his choice. Having played thousands of such games and conquered the hearts of numerous girls, he uses the techniques for courting girls that he learned from scenarios in games on real girls. When he believes he can capture a girl's heart according to a scenario he has played before, he claims, with variations, "Endingu ga mieta!" (エンディングが見えた！), or "I can see the ending!".

"Let's move right along to the next event." (8:45)<br>
"Let's set all sorts of flags with me!" (8:47)<br>
Events and flags are common elements in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel">visual novels</a>. Often times in such games there will be decision points at which the player has to choose how to proceed.

"Super Nyaruko Time is about to begin." (8:50)<br>
There are two references here:<br>
* The Japanese dialogue is "Suupaa Nyaruko-chan Taimu no hajimari desu yo!" (スーパーニャル子ちゃんタイムの始まりですよ！). This is referencing a spin-off manga called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4593856892">"Haiyore! Suupaa Nyaruko-chan Taimu" (這いよれ！スーパーニャル子ちゃんタイム)</a>, or "Crawling!

"In English, they call this a quick start." (8:54)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Eigo de iu to kuikkusutaato!" (英語で言うとクイックスタート！). There are two references here:<br>
* "Quick start" is a term associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop role playing games</a>, TRPG for short, which means starting a game quickly by using a sample character in the rule book as opposed to making a character from scratch.<sup>S1</sup><br>

(10:18)<br>
The setting of the Nyaruko scene during the sunset in a classroom mimics a similar scene from episode 4 (chronologically), or episode 10 (broadcast order), of the anime adaptation of <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6430">"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu"</a> that first aired in 2006.

Note: For here on this episode of "Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu" will be referred to as episode 4 for simplicity.<br>
Warning: The following references in this scene are all spoilers for "Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu".<br>
<br>
"I have grown tired of observing a static subject." (10:27)<br>
The Japanese dialogue for the second screen shot is "Nani mo henka shinai taishou ni, watashi ha mou akiaki shiteiru" (何も変化しない観察対象に、私はもう飽き飽きしている). This is referencing a line said by <span class="spoiler">Asakura Ryouko</span> in episode 4. The original line goes, "Nani mo henka shinai taishou ni, atashi ha mou akiaki shiteru no ne." (何も変化しない観察対象に、あたしはもう飽き飽きしてるのね。), which has the same meaning as above.<br>

(10:30)<br>
The uniform Cthuko is wearing is based on that which female students wear at North High (北高 Kitakou), the high school that the main characters attend in "Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu". Image for reference:<br>

<br>
(10:35)<br>
The line at this time goes as follows:
<blockquote>
「ヒューマノイドインターフェースである私は、強行手段で情報爆発を誘引し、その観測によって情報収集する」<br>
<br>
"Hyuumanoid intaafeesu de aru watashi ha, kyoukou shudan de jouhou bakuhatsu wo yuuin shi, sono kansoku ni yotte joujou shuushuu suru"<br>
<br>
"As a humanoid interface, I create explosions of data using force and gather information through observation."
</blockquote>
There are two references here:<br>
* Two characters from "Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu", <span class="spoiler">Nagato Yuki and Asakura Ryouko</span>, are both humanoid interfaces created by an alien collective known as the Data Integration Thought Entity.<br>
* The phrase "I create explosions of data using force and gather information through observation." is referencing what <span class="spoiler">Asakura Ryouko</span> attempts to do in episode 4.<br>
<br>
"Whose class president do you think you are?" (10:47)<br>
In "Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu", the character that Cthuko is parodying, <span class="spoiler">Asakura Ryouko</span>, is the class president of the class the main characters, Suzumiya Haruhi and Kyon, are in.<br>
<br>

"I will kill you and see how Nyaruko responds."  (10:55)<br>
There are three references here:<br>
* The Japanese dialogue is "Anata wo koroshite, Nyaruko no dekata wo miru" (あなたを殺して、ニャル子の出方を見る). This is referencing a line said by <span class="spoiler">Asakura Ryouko</span> in episode 4. The original line goes, "Anata wo koroshite Suzumiya Haruhi no dekata wo miru" (あなたを殺して涼宮ハルヒの出方を見る), or "I will kill you and see how Suzumiya Haruhi responds."<br>
* The sword that Cthuko wields in this scene is referencing the knife that <span class="spoiler">Asakura Ryouko</span> uses when attempting to kill her target. Also, this sword is the same sword that Yoriko has in <a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/nyaruko_episode_4.html">episode 4</a> of "Haiyore! Nyaruko-san" at 6:22.<br>
* Cthuko's pulling a sword out from under her skirt is based on her doing the same thing in chapter 2 of volume 5 of the "Haiyore! Nyaruko-san" light novel. Also, the appearance of the sword Cthuko pulls out in the anime is the same as that of the sword she pulls out in the light novel.<sup>S3</sup> Illustration from the light novel for reference:<br>

On <a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/nyaruko_vol_5_pg_96.png">page 96 of volume 5</a> of the light novel, the sword is described as,
<blockquote>
クトゥグアが握っている部分は柄に見えた。そこから伸びるのは、夕日を反射して鈍色に光る金属質だ。それは、すなわち刀身だ。そう、刀物なのだった。西洋
の剣のように真っ直ぐに伸びてはおらず、緩く湾曲している。しかし、日本の刀とも明らかに違う。刀身の幅が広すぎるのだ。全体として奇妙なフォルムを持っ
た、剣だか刀だか分からない武器だった。それが鞘にも入れられずに抜き身のままで、クトゥグアのスカートから出てきた。間違っても、そんな体積の物体が入
るスペースなどない。<br>
<br>
Cthugha is grasping a hilt. The thing extending from there is of a metallic quality that reflects the sunset and shines dark gray. Namely it's a sword blade. Yes, some kind of sword thing. It doesn't extend straight like a western sword, but instead, curves gently. However, it is also clearly different from a Japanese katana. The width of the blade is too wide. On the whole it had a strange form, and it was unclear if the weapon was a sword or a katana. That thing, a bare blade not sheathed in the slightest, came out of Cthugha's skirt. There would never be enough space to fit an object of that size.
</blockquote>
- In the light novel Cthuko calls the sword "Baruzai no Tekioo Tou" (バルザイのテキオー刀), or Adaptation Sword of Barzai, which is referencing the Scimitar of Barzai (バルザイの偃月刀 Baruzai no Engetsutou) and the Adaptation Lamp <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%81%88%E3%82%82%E3%82%93%E3%81%AE%E3%81%B2%E3%81%BF%E3%81%A4%E9%81%93%E5%85%B7_%28%E3%81%A6%29#.E3.83.86.E3.82.AD.E3.82.AA.E3.83.BC.E7.81.AF">(テキオー灯 Tekioo Tou)</a>.<sup>S4</sup><br>
- The name is a pun since the same pronunciation, "tou" (とう), can be used for both 「刀」, meaning sword, and 「灯」, meaning light or lamp.<br>
- The Scimitar of Barzai is a bronze scimitar from the Cthulhu Mythos that is said to have the power to summon the Outer God <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yog-Sothoth">Yog-Sothoth</a>. The method of creating the Scimitar of Barzai is mentioned in <a href="http://amzn.com/dp/1871438160">"The Necronomicon: The Book of Dead Names"</a>, edited by George Hay and published in 1994. In Japan the book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4054003877">"Madousho Nekuronomikon" (魔道書ネクロノミコン)</a>, or "Grimoire Necronomicon". Here are the pages detailing how to create the Scimitar of Barzai:<br>

On a related note, the Scimitar of Barzai doesn't seem to have much relation to the character <a href="http://cthulhufiles.com/cthsectb.htm#barzai_the_wise">Barzai</a>, also known as Barzai the Wise. Barzai is an old man from the Cthulhu Mythos who posesses immense knowledge of the "gods of earth", also known as the Great Ones. He appears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Gods">"The Other Gods"</a> and is mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream-Quest_of_Unknown_Kadath">"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath"</a>, two short stories written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> and first published in 1933 and 1943 respectively.<br>
- The Adaptation Lamp is a gun-shaped gadget that shines a special light when used and appears in <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E9%95%B7%E7%B7%A8%E3%83%89%E3%83%A9%E3%81%88%E3%82%82%E3%82%93">"Dai Chou Hen Doraemon" (大長編ドラえもん)</a>, a manga written by <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%AD%90%E3%83%BBF%E3%83%BB%E4%B8%8D%E4%BA%8C%E9%9B%84">Fujiko F. Fujio (藤子・F・不二雄)</a> and published from 1980 to 2004. Shining the Lamp upon oneself enables one to adapt to any pressure condition no matter how high or low. The Lamp first appears in volume 4 when Doraemon and Nobita use it to safely travel to a sunken ship.<br>
- The connection to the Adaptation Lamp is made clear when Mahiro asks what the sword is used for and Cthuko replies,
<blockquote>
「これに斬られる事によって、平素と異なる過酷な環境にも適応できるようになる。」<br>
<br>
"By being cut by this sword, one becomes able to adapt to harsh environments that are different from usual."

"Please listen to me sing, Evil God Knows." (11:25)<br>
The Japanese song name is "Jashin Noozu" (邪神ノーズ). This is a parody of the song "God knows...", which is what Haruhi sings in the above mentioned scene. On a related note, the person who wrote the lyrics for "God Knows...", <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%95%91%E4%BA%9C%E8%B2%B4">Hata Aki (畑亜貴)</a>, also wrote the lyrics for <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%AA%E9%99%BD%E6%9B%B0%E3%81%8F%E7%87%83%E3%81%88%E3%82%88%E3%82%AB%E3%82%AA%E3%82%B9">"Taiyou Iwaku Moe yo Kaosu" (太陽曰く燃えよカオス)</a>, the opening theme song for "Haiyore! Nyaruko-san".<sup>S3</sup><br>
<br>
Song (11:29)<br>
The song that plays at this time is a brief excerpt from "Kurogane no Sutoraibaa" (黒鋼のストライバー), or "Iron Striver", a song sung by <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=13838">Kitamura Eri</a> and <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=17481">Hatano Wataru</a>, the voice actors of Mahiro and Yoichi respectively.

It is also used as Nyaruko's ringtone in <a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/nyaruko_episode_5.html">episode 5</a> at 13:13. The song was released on the "Taiyou Iwaku Moeyo Kaosu" (太陽曰く燃えよカオス) CD single.<sup>S1</sup><br>
<br>
"Mahiro, what about that famous scene with the excellent key animation?" (11:36)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Chouzetsu sakuga no mei shiin ha?" (超絶作画の名シーンは？). "Sakuga" (作画) normally means "key animation", a traditional form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_animation#Animation">animation</a>, which involves drawing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame">key frames</a>, drawings that define the starting and ending points of any smooth transition. After the key animation is approved, frames are drawn in between the key frames to make the movement look fluid. Anime is typically animated with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_animation">"limited animation"</a> style. For example, common parts between frames are reused rather than redrawing entire frames and only the part of the frame that moves is redrawn. Scenes with really well done key animation, called "sakuga" by fans, often involve many key frames, a lot of movement, and a lot of attention to detail, yielding very fluid and lively looking animation. Nyaruko's line is referencing the concert scene in episode 12 of "Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu" which is widely regarded as having excellent key animation. For example, all of the four band members' movements properly correspond to the notes that they're playing and are well synced to the music playing. Also, great care is taken to make the shape of Haruhi's mouth match the lyrics being sung.<br>

(11:51)<br>
There are three references here:<br>
* Derleth is referencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Derleth">August Derleth</a>, a Cthulhu Mythos writer who helped popularize the Mythos and Lovecraft's works.<br>
* The Derleth Restaurant in this scene is based on the family restaurant Wagnaria, which is where all the main characters work at in the series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working!!">"Working!!"</a>. Image for reference:<br>

(11:57)<br>
There are two references here:<br>
* Nyaruko's waitress outfit and ponytail hair style are referencing Taneshima Popura, one of the main characters of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working!!">"Working!!"</a>. On a related note, Nyaruko's voice actor, <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=60780">Asumi Kana</a>, also voices Popura. Image for reference:<br>

* The actual design of Nyaruko's uniform is based not on that worn by characters in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working!!">"Working!!"</a>, but instead on that worn by waitresses that work at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Miller%27s">Anna Miller's</a>, a restaurant chain in Japan and Hawaii that is well known in Japan for its waitress uniforms.<sup>S1</sup> Image for reference:<br>

<br>
"If you're not careful dealing with the manager, a beautiful employee with a Japanese sword will cut you in half." (12:10)<br>
This line is referencing Todoroki Yachiyo, another character from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working!!">"Working!!"</a>. She is known for her beautiful appearance and Japanese sword that she always carries with her. She is also very protective of the restaurant's manager, Shirafuji Kyouko, and tends to threaten those she thinks are coming between her and Kyouko with her sword. On a related note, Mahiro's voice actor, <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=13838">Kitamura Eri</a>, also voices Yachiyo. Images of Yachiyo for reference:<br>
<a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yachiyo.jpg"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yachiyo.jpg"></a> <a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yachiyo_sword.jpg"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yachiyo_sword.jpg"></a><br>
<br>
<a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/bell.jpg"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/bell.jpg"></a><br>
(12:23)<br>
The appearance of the bell resembles that of the faces of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_One">Deep Ones</a>, a species of sea dwelling creature in the Cthulhu Mythos.<sup>S7</sup> "I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though they had white bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed."<sup>S12</sup><br>
<br>
<a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/cthuko_ring.jpg"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/cthuko_ring.jpg"></a><br>
"Miss, please don't keep ringing the bell." (12:27)<br>
Cthuko furiously ringing the bell to alert a waiter is referencing Yamada Aoi, yet another character from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working!!">"Working!!"</a>. In episode 10 of season 1 of "Working!!", Aoi goes to eat at Wagnaria and rings the bell multiple times in rapid succession, much to the annoyance of Takanashi Souta, a waiter who works there. Images for reference:<br>
<a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yamada_ring_1.jpg"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yamada_ring_1.jpg"></a> <a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yamada_ring_2.jpg"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yamada_ring_2.jpg"></a><br>
Note: The text says "Pinpon" (ぴんぽ～ん), a Japanese onomatopoeia for ringing.<br>
<br>
"They're not small." (13:01)<br>
"Huh? Why do I get the feeling someone stole my line?" (13:02)<br>
The Japanese dialogue for the first line is "Chicchakunai yo!" (小っちゃくないよ！). This is Popura's catch phrase in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working!!">"Working!!"</a>, and in this context means "I'm not little!". Popura is short for her age and is very sensitive about her height. She will shout this phrase whenever someone comments on her height. Image for reference:<br>
<a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/WORKING_vol1_pg42_chicchakunai_yo.png"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/WORKING_vol1_pg42_chicchakunai_yo.png"></a><br>
The second line is a follow up to the first. As mentioned earlier, Asumi Kana voices both Nyaruko and Popura. However, Cthuko said Popura's catch phrase rather than Nyaruko, prompting Nyaruko's line.<br>
<br>
"Your new loving mother will..." (13:13)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Shin kankaku iyashikei okaa-san ga..." (新感覚癒し系お母さんが・・・). This is referencing Behoimi, a self-proclaimed Shin Kankaku Iyashikei Mahou Shoujo (新感覚癒し系魔法少女), or New Sensation Healing Magical Girl, from the series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pani_Poni">"Pani Poni"</a>, written by <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B7%E5%B7%9D%E3%81%B8%E3%81%8D%E3%82%8B">Hikawa Hekiru</a>.<sup>S1</sup> There is also a spin off manga series based on Behoimi called <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E6%84%9F%E8%A6%9A%E7%99%92%E3%81%97%E7%B3%BB%E9%AD%94%E6%B3%95%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3%E3%83%99%E3%83%9B%E3%82%A4%E3%83%9F%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83%E3%82%93">"Shin Kankaku Iyashikei Mahou Shoujo Behoimi-chan" (新感覚癒し系魔法少女ベホイミちゃん)</a>, or "New Sensation Healing Magical Girl Behoimi", which is also written by Hikawa.<sup>S2</sup><br>
<br>
<a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yoriko_hairpin.jpg"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/yoriko_hairpin.jpg"></a><br>
(13:24)<br>
The hairpin that Yoriko is wearing is referencing the "false form" of Kero, also known as Keroberos, from the manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardcaptor_Sakura">"Cardcaptor Sakura"</a>.<sup>S1</sup> In the series, Kero usually appears in his false form, which resmbles a yellow stuffed animal with wings. He can also assume his true form, which is a large winged cat. On a related note, Yoriko's voice actor, <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=503">Hisakawa Aya</a>, also voices Kero when he is in his false form in the anime adaptation of "Cardcaptor Sakura" that aired from 1998 to 2000.<sup>S2</sup> Image of Kero for reference:<br>
<a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/ccs_ep2_kero.jpg"><img class="landscape" src="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/ccs_ep2_kero.jpg"></a><br>

(14:05)<br>
There are two references here:<br>
* The event that is going on in this scene is a popular Japanese game called kibasen (騎馬戦), or cavalry battle. Teams typically consist of four players, with three people carrying a rider on top. Each rider wears a headband or a hat. The objective of the game is to eliminate other teams by removing their riders' headbands. The three supporting players will charge at other teams while their rider attempts to grab other riders' headbands while defending his own. Video for reference: <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZHtvEXJeDZk">https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZHtvEXJeDZk</a><br>
* Mahiro, Nyaruko, and Cthuko's weapons are all referencing characters from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku_Basara">"Sengoku Basara"</a> game series. Mahiro's axe is referencing that of Takeda Shingen. Nyaruko wielding three swords in each hand is referencing the same fighting style of Date Masamune. Cthuko wielding a tri-pronged spear in each hand is referencing the same fighting style of Sanada Yukimura.<sup>S1</sup> On a related note, Cthuko and Yukimura can both use fire based attacks.<sup>S3</sup> Images from the anime adaptation for reference:<br>

(14:09)<br>
The uniform that Nyaruko is wearing is based on that worn by characters that work at Wagnaria in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working!!">"Working!!"</a> but with the color of the shirt and the apron switched.<sup>S1</sup> Image for reference:<br>

<br>
"The evil god of romance must be blessing us." (14:21)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Romansu no jashin-sama ga, bokutachi no koto wo shukufuku shite kurete iru mitai da ne" (ロマンスの邪神様が、僕たちのことを祝福してくれているみたいだね). This is referencing <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AE%E7%A5%9E%E6%A7%98">"Romansu no Kami-sama" (ロマンスの神様)</a>, "God of Romance", a song sung by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohmi_Hirose">Hirose Koumi</a> <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BA%83%E7%80%AC%E9%A6%99%E7%BE%8E">(広瀬香美)</a> and released in 1993.<sup>S1</sup><br>
<br>
"It's a handmade Hasta." (14:44)<br>
This is a reference to the anime <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=29">"Hand Maid May"</a>. In the show, the main character, Saotome Kazuya, accidentally orders a palm-sized robotic doll named Hand Maid May. On a related note, Hasta's voice actor, <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=808">Kugimiya Rie</a>, also voiced Cyberdoll Rena in "Hand Maid May".<sup>S3</sup><br>
<br>
"But cast off at your own risk." (14:52)<br>
The phrase "cast off" (キャストオフ kyasuto ofu), is a Japanese phrase that refers to figures that have removable clothing.<sup>S1</sup> This may also be a reference to the same phrase that is often used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Kabuto">"Kamen Rider Kabuto"</a>. Kamen Riders in this series have a "Masked Form" (マスクドフォーム Masukudo Foomu) and a "Rider Form" (ライダーフォーム Raidaa Foomu). When characters transform, they start out in Masked Form, which is heavily armored. Upon executing a trigger unique to each Rider, the Rider will "cast off" the heavy armor and enter Rider Form, which grants access to more powerful abilities.<br>
<br>
Background music (15:14)<br>
The song that plays at this time is referencing "Taboo" (タブー Tabuu), a song played in a collection of skits performed by Japanese comedian <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%A0%E8%97%A4%E8%8C%B6">Katou Cha (加藤茶)</a> of <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B6%E3%83%BB%E3%83%89%E3%83%AA%E3%83%95%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA">"The Drifters" (ザ・ドリフターズ Za Dorifutaazu)</a>, a Japanese comedy group.

(15:48)<br>
Nyaruko is holding a marriage registration document (婚姻届 konintodoke). There are many references on this document.<sup>S1,S3,S7</sup> References will be reported going from left to right, top to bottom.<br>
Starting on the left page:<br>
* In the top left corner is the date of registration, December 25.<br>
* Below the date is the place of registration, Ninagawa-ku (蜷川区), or Ninagawa Ward. This is the name of the fictional city that is the setting of the Cthulhu Mythos inspired light novel <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4569674607">"Uchi no Meido ha Futeikei" (うちのメイドは不定形)</a>, or "My Maid is an Amorphous Blob", written by Shizukawa Tassou (静川龍宗) and published in 2010.<br>
* Nyaruko has filled in her name as Yasaka Nyaruratohotepu (八坂 ニャルラトホテプ).<br>
* Below Nyaruko's name is her date of birth, April 15, 2009. This is the date of release of the first volume of "Haiyore! Nyaruko-san". Amazon.co.jp link for reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4797354143">http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4797354143</a><br>
* The first half of the permanent residence (本籍 honseki) is Wisconsin State Wood of N'gai (ウィスコンシン州 ン・ガイの森 Uisukonshin shuu N'gai no Mori). The Wood of N'gai is a large and thick forest that exudes a sinister aura and is said to be located in north central Wisconsin. It is featured prominently in "The Dweller in Darkness", a short story written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Derleth">August Derleth</a> and first published in 1944. The forest is the dwelling place of the Dweller in Darkness, an avatar of Nyarlathotep, and is one of Nyarlathotep's most sacred spots.<br>
* The second half of the permanent residence is 1920 11. The November 1920 issue of The United Amateur is the magazine in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft">Lovecraft</a> first published the short story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyarlathotep_%28Short_Story%29">"Nyarlathotep"</a>, which is the first time Nyarlathotep is mentioned in the Cthulhu Mythos.<br>
* Below the address, Nyaruko writes her name down as the head of the family (筆頭者 Hittousha).<br>
* Nyaruko's father is Hyakuman no Mederareshi Mono no Chichi (百万の愛でられしものの父), or Father of the Million Favoured Ones, which is another one of Nyarlathotep's names. It is mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Whisperer_in_Darkness">"The Whisperer in Darkness"</a>, a short story written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> and first published in 1931.<br>
* Nyaruko's mother is 「大胖女人」 (Da Pang Nuren), which means "big fat woman" in Chinese. This is referencing the Bloated Woman (膨れ女 fukure onna), an avatar of Nyarlathotep who appears as a 600-pound female humanoid equipped with numerous tentacles in addition to two arms and two legs. She manifests in Shanghai and is worshipped by the Order of the Bloated Woman, a cult that is almost exclusively Chinese. All cultists have a tattoo of the text 「大胖女人」 in their left armpits.<sup>S10</sup> <a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/order_of_the_bloated_woman.png">Here is an excerpt from "The Complete Masks of Nyarlathotep" for reference.</a><br>
* To the right of Nyaruko's father and mother is familial relationship (続き柄 tsudukigara), to which Nyaruko writes eldest (長 chou) for eldest daughter.<br>
* The new permanent residence (新本籍 shin honseki) is Tokyo-to Ninagawa-ku Nanahongi 2-4-5 (東京都蜷川区七本木2-4-5), or address 2-4-5 in the Nanahongi district in the city of Ninagawa within the Tokyo Metropolis. As mentioned above, Ninagawa is the setting of the light novel "Uchi no Meido ha Futeikei". The address as a whole is parodying the address Tokyo-to Minato-ku Roppongi 2-4-5 (東京都港区六本木2-4-5), or address 2-4-5 in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roppongi">Roppongi</a> district in the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minato,_Tokyo">Minato</a> within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan#Tokyo-to">Tokyo Metropolis</a>. This is the <a href="http://www.softbankcr.co.jp/ja/info/access/">address of SoftBank Creative</a>, the company that publishes the "Haiyore! Nyaruko-san" novel.<br>
* To the left of the new permanent residence Nyaruko checks off husband's family name (夫の氏 otto no uji) for specifying which family name the couple will use after being married.<br>
* Nyaruko checks off first marriage (初婚 shokon).<br>
* Nyaruko checks off the type of occupation she has as an employee of a company that has more than 99 employees.<br>
* Nyaruko's occupation is Wakusei Hogo Kikou Shoku (惑星保護機構職), or Planetary Defense Organization Job.<br>
On the right page Nyaruko lists two people who are to bear witness to the marriage.<br>
Starting with the left column:<br>
* The name is Harvey Walters. Harvey is a sample character in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Cthulhu_%28role-playing_game%29">"Call of Cthulhu"</a> RPG rulebook. <a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/call_of_cthulhu_5th_edition_harvey_walters_1.png">Page from the 5th edition "Call of Cthulhu" RPG rulebook for reference</a>.<br>
* His birthdate is 1902/3/15. March 15, 1902 is Harvey's birthdate as stated in the 5th edition of the "Call of Cthulhu" RPG rulebook. <a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/images/ep8/call_of_cthulhu_5th_edition_harvey_walters_2.png">Page for reference</a>.<br>
* His address (住所 juusho) and permanent residence (本籍 honseki) are Boston, MA. In the "Call of Cthulhu" RPG rulebook Harvey's birthplace and residence are stated to be Boston, Massachusetts.<br>
In the right column:<br>
* The name is Maino Gurako (毎野グラ子). This name is based on <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%9E%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8E%E3%82%B0%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A9">Mainoguura (マイノグーラ)</a>, or Mynoghra, a deity that appears in the Cthulhu Mythos. She is Nyarlathotep's cousin and appears in "Wings in the Night", a story written by E. P. Berglund and first published in 1975.<br>
* Her birthdate is 096594/33/64. 0965943364 is the ISBN of <a href="http://amzn.com/dp/0965943364">"Shards of Darkness"</a>, a book containing 11 Cthulhu Mythos stories written by E. P. Berglund, including "Wings in the Night".<br>
* Her address and permanent residence are Kyuukyoku no konoton no chuushin (窮極の混沌の中心), or the Center of Ultimate Chaos. This is referencing the deity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azathoth">Azathoth</a> from the Cthulhu Mythos. Azathoth is said to be located "at the centre of ultimate Chaos."<sup>S14</sup> In addition, Nyarlathotep is said to be the "soul and messenger of the Other Gods", including Azathoth.<sup>S15</sup> This implies that Nyarlathotep was created by Azathoth and also originates at the center of ultimate chaos.<br>
* Underneath "Kyuukyoku no konoton no chuushin" Nyaruko writes "chotto hazureta" (ちょっとはずれた), or "a little off place", for address and "daitai mannaka" (だいたい真ん中), or "basically the center", for permanent residence. Like Nyarlathotep, Mynoghra was created by Azathoth, so she originates from the center of ultimate chaos. Also like Nyarlathotep, Mynoghra is an Outer God and not imprisoned like the other Outer Gods. However, she does not act as a messenger for the Outer Gods like Nyarlathotep does, so her status is generally unknown, explaining the "a little off place" and "basically the center" comments.<br>

There are two references here:<br>
* Hasta's outfit is referencing that of Bridget from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilty_Gear_%28series%29">"Guilty Gear"</a> fighting game series. On a related note, Bridget, like Hasta, is an effeminate looking male character. Image for reference:<br>

* Note: Hasta's stats are likely supposed to be the same as the stats for Hastur in the "Call of Cthulhu" RPG. However, if this is the case, then there is an error in the screen since it displays the same stats as Cthugha. Here are Hastur's stats.<sup>S8</sup><br>

<br>
"Follow your racing instincts." (17:24)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Shissou suru honnou no mama ni!" (疾走する本能のままに！). This is referencing the phrase "Shissou suru honnou" (疾走する本能), or "Racing instinct", which is the catch phrased used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_555">"Kamen Rider 555"</a>.<sup>S1</sup> While the phrase is not used in the actual show, it is the official tagline used in promotional material. (Thanks TV-Nihon and MintySocks) In regards to the tagline, one of the producers of the show, Hamada Chika (濱田千佳) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Asahi">TV Asahi</a>, stated, "In accordance with the program's catch phrase, 'Racing Instinct', I am hoping to instill into children the message of living your life while staying true to your feelings." (番組のキャッチコピー"疾走する本能"の通り、子供たちに自分の心に正直に生きて欲しいというメッセージを込めて行ければいいなと思っております).<sup>S9</sup><br>
<br>
"Awaken your souls." (17:28)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Mezamero, sono tamashii!" (目覚めろ、その魂！). This line is the catch phrase used in the next episode previews for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Agito">"Kamen Rider Agito"</a>.<sup>S1</sup><br>
<br>
"If you do not fight, you will die." (17:30)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Tatakawanakereba, ikinokorenai!" (戦わなければ生き残れない！). This line is the catch phrase used in the next episode previews for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Ryuki">"Kamen Rider Ryuki"</a>.<sup>S1</sup><br>
<br>
"A boy and a girl are accidentally locked in inside the gym storage closet and have to spend the night together." (17:58)<br>
This kind of situation seems to be fairly common in anime and manga and such. For example:<br>
* In episode 2 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Please_Teacher!">"Please Teacher!"</a>, Kusanagi Kei and Kazami Mizuho, the two main characters, are accidentally locked inside the gym storage room during school hours and are stuck there until late at night when they are finally found and let out by Kei's uncle.<br>
* In episode 17 of <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=7809">"Clannad"</a>, Okazaki Tomoya and Fujibayashi Kyou, two of the main characters, are accidentally locked inside the gym storage room due to a charm. They are let out quickly, however, due to Tomoya dispelling the charm.<sup>S1</sup><br>

(18:43)<br>
Like in <a href="https://nyaruref.github.io/nyaruko/nyaruko_episode_2.html">episode 2</a> at 16:32, Cthuko's lying down state mimics that of Matsuoka Miu from the series <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8B%BA%E3%81%BE%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%82%8D">"Ichigo Mashimaro" (苺ましまろ)</a>, localized as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Marshmallow">"Strawberry Marshmallow"</a>.<sup>S1</sup> Image for reference:<br>

"I have no regrets." (18:47)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Waga shougai ni ippen no kui nashi!" (わが生涯に一片の悔いなし！). Nyaruko's line and pose are referencing the same line and pose said and done by Raoh in chapter 136 of volume 16 of the manga <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=1547">"Fist of the North Star"</a>.<sup>S1</sup> Image for reference:<br>

<br>
"In order to reach our good ending, under this tree with some sort of a history, we must pledge our love to each other for eternity with a kiss." (19:41)<br>
This is referencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokimeki_Memorial">"Tokimeki Memorial"</a>. On the school grounds is a large tree. In the beginning of the game, Yoshio tells the player about the school legend.
<blockquote>
「あの木の下で女の子に告白されると、永遠に幸せな関係になれるんだってよ。」<br>
<br>
"Ano ki no shita de onnanoko ni kokuhaku sareru to, eien ni shiawase na kankei ni nareru n da tte yo."<br>
<br>
"It's said that if a girl confesses her love to you underneath that tree, the two of you will live happily ever after."<br>
</blockquote>
At the end of the game the player's true love confesses to him under the tree. Images for reference:<br>

<br>
"It seems the setting of the next episode is Onomichi." (23:45)<br>
"It's a three-parter." (23:48)<br>
The Japanese lines are "Nan demo jikai ha Onomichi ga butai rashii desu yo" (なんでも次回は尾道が舞台らしいですよ) and "Sanbusaku teki na" (三部作的な). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomichi,_Hiroshima">Onomichi</a> is a city located in the Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan. It is also the hometown of director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuhiko_Obayashi">Obayashi Nobuhiko (大林宣彦)</a> who has worked on many films, including <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%BB%A2%E6%A0%A1%E7%94%9F_%28%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB%29">"Tenkousei" (転校生)</a>, released in 1982, <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%99%82%E3%82%92%E3%81%8B%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E5%B0%91%E5%A5%B3_%281983%E5%B9%B4%E3%81%AE%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB%29">"Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo" (時をかける少女)</a>, released in 1983, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%95%E3%81%B3%E3%81%97%E3%82%93%E3%81%BC%E3%81%86_%28%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB%29">"Sabishinbou" (さびしんぼう)</a>, released in 1985. These three films in particular all take place in Onomichi, and together they are called <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%A7%E6%9E%97%E5%AE%A3%E5%BD%A6#.E5.B0.BE.E9.81.93.E4.B8.89.E9.83.A8.E4.BD.9C">Onomichi Sanbusaku (尾道三部作)</a>, or Onomichi Trilogy, which is what Nyaruko is referring to when she says "It's a three-parter". In addition, Obayashi directed three other movies that also take place in Onomichi, and together they are called Shin Onomichi Sanbusaku (新尾道三部作), or New Onomichi Trilogy. The films are <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%B5%E3%81%9F%E3%82%8A">"Futari" (ふたり)</a>, released in 1991, <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%82%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F_%28%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB%29">"Ashita" (あした)</a>, released in 1995, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%82%E3%81%AE%E3%80%81%E5%A4%8F%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5">"Ano, Natsu no Hi" (あの、夏の日)</a>, released in 1999.<sup>S1</sup><br>
<br>
"I am Her and She is Me." (23:50)<br>
The Japanese title is "Boku ga Aitsu de Aitsu ga Boku de" (僕があいつであいつが僕で). This is referencing a children's book written by <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B1%B1%E4%B8%AD%E6%81%92">Yamanaka Hisashi (山中恒)</a> called <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%81%8A%E3%82%8C%E3%81%8C%E3%81%82%E3%81%84%E3%81%A4%E3%81%A7%E3%81%82%E3%81%84%E3%81%A4%E3%81%8C%E3%81%8A%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A7">"Ore ga Aitsu de Aitsu ga Ore de" (おれがあいつであいつがおれで)</a>, which has the same meaning as above. The story is about a boy and a girl who mysteriously switch bodies. Since the book's publication, it has had several adaptations, from movies to TV dramas. One such adaptation is the above mentioned movie, <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%BB%A2%E6%A0%A1%E7%94%9F_%28%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB%29">"Tenkousei" (転校生)</a> directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuhiko_Obayashi">Obayashi Nobuhiko (大林宣彦)</a>.<sup>S1</sup><br>
<br>
(23:53)<br>
The Japanese dialogue is "Kaamii-" (かーみー). What Nyaruko was going to say before being interrupted by Mahiro is "Kaamiichuu!" (かーみーちゅー！). This is a phrase shouted by Hitotsubashi Yurie, the main character of the anime <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamichu!">"Kamichu!"</a>. The title is short for "Kami-sama de Chuugakusei" (神様で中学生), or "A God as a Middle School Student". This anime also takes place in Onomichi.<sup>S1,S2</sup><br>
